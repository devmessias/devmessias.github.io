We are increasing the **cognitive load** in the terms presented in the excelsior book: [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://linghao.io/notes/a-philosophy-of-software-design).\n",
    "    -   A person who is not familiar with the codebase cannot understand what is happening by analyzing the outputs of the decorator. If these outputs are being stored in the ELK stack, this will be unproductive.\n",

    "    -   The final internal state of the method is commonly used to understand the execution of a method.\n",
    "    -   Sometimes a method depends on random variables defined in the local context. Thus, the same set of arguments can give different executions. Until now, we don't have a way to get the `locals()` of the decorated method. For example, in the `snooze_and_snore` we can't know if the person snored or not.\n",
