## Abstract

We have changed some points of my project in the first meeting.
Specifically, we focused the efforts into developing a streaming system
using the WebRTC protocol that could be used in more generic scenarios
than just the network visualization. In addition to that, we have opted
to develop the network visualization for fury as a separated repository
and package available [here](https://github.com/fury-gl/helios). The
name Helios was selected for this new network visualization system based
on the Fury rendering pipeline.

## Proposed Objectives

-   Create a streaming system (stadia-like) for FURY
    -   Should work in a low-bandwidth scenario
    -   Should allow user interactions and collaboration across the
        Internet using a web-browser
-   Helios Network System objectives:
    -   Implement the Force-Directed Algorithm with examples
    -   Implement the ForceAtlas2 algorithm using cugraph with examples
    -   Implement Minimum-Distortion Embeddings algorithm (PyMDE) and
        examples
    -   Non-blocking network algorithms computation avoiding the GIL
        using the Shared Memory approach
    -   Create the documentation and the actions for the CI
-   Stretch Goals:
    -   Create an actor in FURY to draw text efficiently using shaders
    -   Add support to draw millions of nodes using FURY
    -   Add support to control the opengl state on FURY

## Objectives Completed

-   **Create a streaming system (stadia-like) for FURY**

    There are several reasons to have a streaming system for data
    visualization. Because I am doing my Ph.D.Â in developing country, I
    always need to think of the less expensive solutions to use the
    computational resources available. For example, with the GPU's
    prices increasing, it is necessary to share the a single machine
    with GPU with other users at different locations.

    To construct the streaming system for my project we have opted to
    follow three main properties and behaviors:

    1.  avoid blocking the code execution in the main thread (where the
        vtk/fury instance resides)
    2.  work inside of a low bandwidth environment
    3.  make it easy and cheap to share the rendering result. For
        example, using the free version of `ngrok`

    To achieve the first property we need to circumvent the GIL and
    allow python code to execute in parallel. Using the threading module
    alone is not good enough to reach real parallelism as Python calls
    in the same process can not execute concurrently. In addition to
    that, to achieve better organization it is desirable to define the
    server system as an uncoupled module from the rendering pipeline.
    Therefore, I have chosen to employ the multiprocessing approach for
    that. The second and third property can be only achieved choosing a
    suitable protocol for transfering the rendered results to the
    client. We have opted to implement two streaming protocols: the
    MJPEG and the WebRTC. The latter is more suitable for low-bandwidth
    scenarios \[1\].

    The image below shows a simple representation of the streaming
    system.

    The video below shows how our streaming system works smothly and can
    be easily integrated inside of a Jupyter notebook.

*Pull Requests:* \* <https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/480>

-   **2D and 3D marker actor**

    This feature gave FURY the ability to efficiently draw millions of
    markers and impostor 3D spheres. This feature was essential for the
    development of Helios. This feature work with signed distance fields
    (SDFs) you can get more information about how SDFs works here \[4\]
    .

    The image below shows 1 million of markers rendered using an Intel
    HD graphics 3000.

-   **Fine-Tunning the OpenGl State**

    Sometimes users may need to have finer control on how OpenGL will
    render the actors. This can be useful when they need to create
    specialized visualization effects or to improve the performance.

    In this PR I have worked in a feature that allows FURY to control
    the OpenGL context created by VTK

-   **Helios Network Visualization Lib: Network Layout Algorithms**

    **Case 1:** Suppose that you need to monitor a hashtag and build a
    social graph. You want to interact with the graph and at the same
    time get insights about the structure of the user interactions. To
    get those insights you can perform a node embedding using any kind
    of network layout algorithm, such as force-directed or minimum
    distortion embeddings.

    **Case 2:** Suppose that you are modelling a network dynamic such as
    an epidemic spreading or a Kuramoto model. In some of those network
    dynamics a node can change the state and the edges related to the
    node must be deleted. For example, in an epidemic model a node can
    represent a person who died due to a disease. Consequently, the
    layout of the network must be recomputed to give better insights.

    In the described cases, if we want a better (UX) and at the same
    time a more practical and insightful application of Helios, the
    employed layout algorithms should not block any kind of computation
    in the main thread.

    In Helios we already have a lib written in C (with a python wrapper)
    which performs the force-directed layout algorithm using separated
    threads avoiding the GIL problem and consequently avoiding blocking
    the main thread. But what about the other open-source network layout
    libs available on the internet? Unfortunately, most of those libs
    have not been implemented like Helios force-directed methods and
    consequently, if we want to update the network layout the Python
    interpreter will block the computation and user interaction in your
    network visualization.

    My solution for having PyMDE and CuGraph-ForceAtlas not blocking the
    main thread was to break the network layout method into two
    different types of processes: A and B and communicate both process
    using the Shared Memory approach. You can more information about
    this PR through my following posts \[2\], \[3\].

The image below show an example that I made and is available at
<https://github.com/fury-gl/helios/blob/main/docs/examples/viz_mde.py>

-   **Helios Network Visualization Lib: Visual Aspects**

I've made several stuffs to give Helios a better visual aspects. One of
them was to give a smooth real-time network layout animations. Because
the layout computations happens into a different process that the
process responsible to render the network was necessary to record the
positions and communicate the state of layout between both process.

The GIF below shows how the network layout through IPC behaved before
these modification

below, you can see how after those modifications the visual aspect is
better.

-   **Helios Network Visualization Lib: CI and Documentation**

Because Helios was an project that begins in my GSoC project It was
necessary to create the documentation, hosting and more. Now we have a
online documentation available at <https://heliosnetwork.io/> altough
the documentation still need some improvements.

Below is presented the Helios Logo which was developed by my mentor
Filipi Nascimento.
